## Watson frame builder(converter)


[Watson](https://github.com/TailorDev/Watson) is CLI app for tracking your work time distribution.

Sometimes I have to use Windows to do some tasks and then I can't use watson to track my time.
The first workaround that came to my mind is to note spent time by myself in some .txt file and when I switch to Linux I can add it manually to watson.
Of course, manual input of frames is pretty tedious task so I made this tiny java pogram to help me with it. 

In executableJAR folder is runnable JAR with its manual how to run it. Also it contains file "frames.txt" which shows format that shall be used.

I made this program for personal usage, so it probably doesn't cover all edge cases and bugs but code is pretty simple so you can edit it for your own needs.
